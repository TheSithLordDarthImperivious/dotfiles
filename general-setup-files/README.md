# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles (General Dotfiles)

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

Fonts and wallpapers were generally taken from the internet. They are **not** mine.

# How to install?

Run the script in the base directory of the setup. Make sure that you are in the b
ase directory of the setup or it won't work.

# What is this?

This is just for general dotfiles which are independent of windowing system (eg. command line utilities). This will generally be merged with each setup.
