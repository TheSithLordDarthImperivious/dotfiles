# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles (Wayland)

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to install?

Run the script in the base directory of the setup. Make sure that you are in the b
ase directory of the setup or it won't work.

# Why no dpi?

Wayland handles DPI automatically. Xorg usually does not do it well.
