# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles (Xorg: 96 dpi)

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to use?

Who needs install scripts? Just copy/symlink them manually. All of these are meant to be able to be used in all Unix-like OSes.

# What is 96 dpi?

96 dpi is essentially what most computers use. If you are not using any scaling by default, chances are you are using 96 dpi.

Common resolutions include: 1024x768, 1366x768, 1600x900.
