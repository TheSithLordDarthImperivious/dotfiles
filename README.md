# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles (General Dotfiles)

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

Fonts and wallpapers were generally taken from the internet. They are **not** mine.

# How to use?

Who needs install scripts? Just copy/symlink them manually. All of these are meant to be able to be used in all Unix-like OSes.

# What is this?

This is just for general dotfiles which are independent of windowing system (eg. command line utilities). This will generally be merged with each setup.
