# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles (Wayland)

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to use?

Who needs install scripts? Just copy/symlink them manually. All of these are meant to be able to be used in all Unix-like OSes.

# Why no dpi?

Wayland handles DPI automatically. Xorg usually does not do it well.
