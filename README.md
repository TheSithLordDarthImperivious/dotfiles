# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to install?

Run the script in the base directory of the setup. Make sure that you are in the b
ase directory of the setup or it won't work.

For macOS, only the generic stuff will work.

# I don't see them. Where are they?

They are generally located in branches so that I can organize them. setup-96dpi is xorg 96dpi, setup-192dpi is xorg 192dpi, and setup-wayland is wayland.
