# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to install?

Run the script in the base directory of the setup that you want to use. Make sure that you are in the base directory of the specific setup you want to install or it won't work.

# I don't see them. Where are they?

They are generally located in different folders so that I can organize them. setup-96dpi is xorg 96dpi, setup-192dpi is xorg 192dpi, and setup-wayland is wayland. general-setup-files is any dotfiles that are agonistic across all three setups. general-xorg-files is any xorg stuff that are dpi-agonistic.
