# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to use?

Who needs install scripts? Just copy/symlink them manually. All of these are meant to be able to be used in all Unix-like OSes.

# I don't see them. Where are they?

They are generally located in branches so that I can organize them. setup-96dpi is xorg 96dpi, setup-192dpi is xorg 192dpi, and setup-wayland is wayland.
