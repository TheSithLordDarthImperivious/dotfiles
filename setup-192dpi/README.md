# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles (Xorg: 192 dpi)

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to use?

Who needs install scripts? Just copy/symlink them manually. All of these are meant to be able to be used in all Unix-like OSes.

# What is 192 dpi?

192 dpi is generally used in stuff like 4K displays.

NOTE: This setup will be the **least** updated since I normally would use Wayland on these machines.
