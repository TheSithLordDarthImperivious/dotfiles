# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles (Xorg: 192 dpi)

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to install?

Run the script in the base directory of the setup. Make sure that you are in the base directory of the setup or it won't work.

# What is 192 dpi?

192 dpi is generally used in stuff like 4K displays.

NOTE: This setup will be the **least** updated since I normally would use Wayland on these machines.
