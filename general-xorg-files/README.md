# A Sith Lord's Dotfiles (General Xorg Dotfiles)

This repo was made for easy syncing of dotfiles across all of my machines. If you want to look at them, sure. No preview though.

# How to install?

Run the script in the base directory of the setup. Make sure that you are in the base directory of the setup or it won't work.

# What is this?

This is just for general xorg dotfiles which are independent of DPI. This will generally be merged with each xorg setup.
